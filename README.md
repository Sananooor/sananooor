### Fun Facts & Bio

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between wet-lab biology and computational analysis, making complex science approachable and actionable for all. Outside of research, you’ll find me writing poems and prose, mentoring students, binge-watching crime thrillers, and planning my next travel adventure (the Netherlands is on my dream list!).  

**Fun fact:** I’ve worn glasses since 6th grade, but seeing the “big picture” in science has always come naturally.

**Short Bio:**

### Fun Facts & Bio

Outside of research, you’ll find me writing poems and prose, mentoring students, binge-watching crime thrillers, and planning my next travel adventure (A lot is on my dream list!).  

**Fun fact:** I’ve worn glasses since 6th grade, but seeing the “big picture” in science has always come naturally.
